The aim for my portfolio is showcase all the computer science realted projects and investigations I have done. My goal 
is to go to college and study mechanical engineering so I think a portfolio with computerscience and coding would look really good.
My portfolio now contains some of these elements but I would need to completely re-work it in order to make it as effective as possible.

Based on the videos and the examples in the videos it would be smart to showcase my big projects. Along with this it is important to show
some planning or pictures of the project in development to show my thought process and how I got to the end result. I think this way of
setting up my portfolio will make it look very neat and effectively show my interest and success in this field. It also will show that
I am a good canidate for engineering becuase I have created things in the past.

This course is nice because it teaches you how to model the ideas you are thinking in a cad software. This makes
it easy to then 3d print or machine so that you can have an actual part in the end.

This textbook teaches you how to reverse engineering already made things. This is really cool and help to give you lots 
of ideas for different things to make. Also if you need to make an improvement for something it is important to know
how something works before you make the fix in order to ensure success.

This python course helps to show how you can apply this coding language to engieering and science fields. This is cool
because I know somewhat how to code in python and also I really want to be an engineer so it fits well.

What I did this time to my portfolio is just updating it with some of the projects I have done in the last few months. I also added
a few months to the month by month breakdown. This is where I was able to show more of the behind the scenes and all the topics I learned
in class. Later this year or this summer I will apply what I learned in the videos to my portfolio and completely redo it.
